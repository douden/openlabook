This book is suited for a standard linear algebra course for engineering students at a bachelor level. Except for some basic algebra skills generally taught in secondary education, no prior knowledge is expected.

The main concepts of linear algebra are introduced from a geometrical perspective. We start by introducing the basic concepts of vectors, lines, and planes. There follows a thorough treatment of standard subjects like systems of linear equations, matrix arithmetic, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality etc. In the final chapters, more advanced topics like symmetric matrices and discrete dynamical systems are discussed.

Throughout the book, many interactive applets are inserted to give the student hands-on experience with linear algebra. Thanks to an ample selection of embedded exercises with individualized feedback, the book offers a stimulating learning environment for studying linear algebra!

Work on this book started in the summer of 2021 with the goal of creating an interactive open access linear algebra book for engineering students. The team behind the book consists of about ten lecturers, with a lot of experience teaching linear algebra to engineering students, backed by a wide range of supporting staff and student assistants.

Funding for this project was provided by a grant from the <a href="https://www.nponderwijs.nl/" target="_blank">NPO (Nationaal Programma Onderwijs)</a>. During the project the team collaborated closely with <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics/studeren/prime" target="_blank">PRIME (PRogramme of Innovation in Mathematics Education)</a>.
